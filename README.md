# MATLAB Project
A project created in MATLAB for an introductory programming course. Recreates the card game *Rich Man Poor Man*, also known by its original Japanese name 大富豪 (Daifugō). Allows for 3-8 player characters to play, with the option for a round limit to determine winners. To play, clone the repo and run `gameRun.m` within a MATLAB terminal in the parent directory.
